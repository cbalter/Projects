This is a simple simulation function of a forest fire to model the 2019-2020 Australian Forest Fires.

The following instructions were given, 

"Simulation starts with a known number of trees burning
For each burning tree, there are a random number of trees (defined by a
geometric distribution with `prob = 0.5`) within the "danger zone"
Each tree within the "danger zone" has a fixed probability of catching on fire
As each new tree catches fire, the cycle repeats"
